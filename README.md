# YDS Project : Building Neural Turing Machine 

Although there are tons of Neural Turing Machine implementations on github already, 
not many built an actual library for NTM so that people can experiment with it.

The goal of this project is to build NTM library in TensorFlow. 

**Note**: 
- For those who are interested in contributing to this project, please read [List of Tasks](), pick one, implement it, and send us a pull request.
